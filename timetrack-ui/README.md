# TimeTrack UI

## Project Reflection

### Time Spent
Approximately 15-20 hours total, spread across multiple development sessions.

### What I Did/Didn't Like

#### Liked:
- The challenge of creating a comprehensive time tracking application

- Designing a clean, responsive user interface
- Working with React and Next.js
- Implementing pagination and dynamic log management

#### Didn't Like:
- Initial complexity of state management

   - Add multi-factor authentication
   - Create more granular user roles and permissions

2. **Improved Performance**
   - Implement more advanced caching mechanisms
   - Add server-side rendering optimizations
   - Create more efficient state management using Redux or Zustand

3. **Additional Features**

   - Add export functionality for logs (CSV, PDF)
   - Create more advanced filtering options
   - Develop a reporting dashboard

### Satisfied Aspects
- Responsive and intuitive UI
- Real-time search functionality
- Smooth timer management
- Pagination implementation
- Error handling and user feedback

### Areas Needing Improvement
