# TimeTrack Backend

## Project Reflection

### Time Spent
Approximately 15-20 hours total, spread across multiple development sessions.

### What I Did/Didn't Like

#### Liked:
- Designing a clean, RESTful API architecture
- Implementing domain-driven design principles
- Working with Django and Django Rest Framework
- Creating flexible time logging endpoints
- Implementing search and pagination functionality

#### Didn't Like:
- Complexity of handling timezone-aware datetime operations
- Initial setup of authentication and permissions
- Ensuring consistent serialization across different endpoints

### What I Would Have Done Differently with More Time

1. **Enhanced Authentication**
   - Implement more robust token management
   - Add OAuth2 support
   - Create more granular permission systems

2. **Improved Performance**
   - Add database indexing for faster queries
   - Implement caching mechanisms
   - Optimize database queries
   - Add more advanced filtering and search capabilities

3. **Additional Features**
   - Develop more comprehensive logging and monitoring
   - Create background tasks for data aggregation
   - Add more advanced reporting capabilities
   - Implement data export functionality

### Satisfied Aspects
- Clean, modular code structure
- Flexible time logging API
- Search and pagination implementation
- Basic authentication and authorization
- Error handling and validation

### Areas Needing Improvement
- More comprehensive test coverage
- Advanced performance optimization
- More detailed logging and monitoring
- Expanded documentation
- Internationalization support

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.10+
- pip
- virtualenv (recommended)

### Installation
1. Clone the repository
2. Create a virtual environment
